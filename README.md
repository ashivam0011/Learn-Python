# Python Tutorials

Hey there! 👋 This repository contains my Python learning journey - from basics to more advanced concepts. I've been working through different topics and keeping all my practice code and solutions organized here.

## 📁 Repository Structure

```
PythonTutorials/
├── 01_Basics/          # Basic Python concepts and list problems
├── 02Functions/        # Functions tutorial with examples
└── 03OOPS/            # Object-Oriented Programming concepts
```

## 📚 What's Inside

### 01_Basics
Contains fundamental Python concepts and practice problems, including:
- Basic syntax and operations
- List manipulation problems and solutions
- Getting started with Python

### 02Functions
Comprehensive tutorial on Python functions covering:
- Function definition and calling
- Parameters and arguments
- Return values
- Advanced function concepts

### 03OOPS
Detailed Object-Oriented Programming tutorial (`01Solutions.py`) that covers:
- Classes and objects
- Inheritance
- Encapsulation
- Polymorphism
- Class methods and static methods
- Property decorators
- Multiple inheritance
- Special methods (dunder methods)
- Abstract base classes
- Composition vs Inheritance
- Practical examples (Library Management System)

The OOP file is pretty comprehensive - it has 14 different sections with detailed comments explaining each concept step by step. Great for reference when you need to brush up on OOP concepts!

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd PythonTutorials
   ```

2. Navigate to any folder and run the Python files:
   ```bash
   python 03OOPS/01Solutions.py
   ```

3. Each file is self-contained with examples and explanations, so you can run them directly or use them as reference material.

## 💡 Notes

- All code includes detailed comments explaining the concepts
- Examples are practical and easy to understand
- Feel free to modify and experiment with the code
